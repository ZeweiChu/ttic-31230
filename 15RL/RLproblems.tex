{\bf Problem 1.}
Consider training machine translation on a corpus of translation pairs $(x,y)$ where $x$ is, say, an English sentence $x_1,\ldots,\mathrm{EOS}$ and $y$ is a French sentence $y_1,\ldots,\mathrm{EOS}$
where EOS is the ``end of sentence'' tag.

\medskip
Suppose that we have a parameterized model defining $P_\Phi(y_t|x,y_1,\ldots,y_{t-1})$ so that $P_\Phi (y_1,\ldots,y_{T}|x) = \prod_{t=1}^{T'}P_\Phi(y_t|x,y_1,\ldots,y_{t-1})$ where $y_T$ is EOS.

\medskip
For a sample $\hat{y}$ from $P_\Phi(y|x)$ we also have a non-differentiable BLEU score $\mathrm{BLUE}(hat{y},y) \geq 0$ that is not computed until the entire output $y$ is complete
and which we would like to maximize.

\medskip
(a) Give the SGD update equations for the parameters $\Phi$ for the REINFORCE algorithm for maximizing $E_{\hat{y} \sim P_\Phi(y|x)}$ for this problem.

\medskip
(b) Suppose that somehow we reach a parameter setting $\Phi$ where $P_\Phi(y|x)$ assigns probability close enough to 1 for a particular translation $\hat{y}$
that in practice we will always sample the same $\hat{y}$.  Suppose that this translation $\hat{y}$ has less than optimal BLEU score.
Can the REINFORCE algorithm recover from this situation and consider other translations?  Explain your answer.

\medskip
(c) Repeat part (b) but under the assumption that $\mathrm{BLEU}(\hat{y},y) \leq 0$ (if there is a maximum reward $R_{\mathrm{max}}$ we can replace $R$ by $R- R_{\mathrm{max}}$).

\medskip
(d) Modify the REINFORCE update equations to use a value function approximation $V_\Phi(x)$ to reduce the variance in the gradient samples.  Your equations should include updates to train
$V_\Phi(x)$ to predict $E_{\hat{y} \sim P(y|x)}\;\mathrm{BLEU}(\hat{y},y)$.  (Replace the reward by the ``advantage'' of the particular translation).
