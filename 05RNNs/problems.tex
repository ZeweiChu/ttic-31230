    {\bf Problem 2. (10 points)} This problem is on RNNs.  Explain why gating is needed for the highway path (skip connections) in RNNs but not in resnet.

    
{\bf Problem 3. (20 points)} What is the order of the number of floating point operations (serial computer running time)
as a function of input sentence length and output sentence length
for both the forward and backward pass of sequence to sequence models for machine translation both with and without attention.

\bigskip
{\bf Problem:} Consider a simple synthetic grammar and analyze the difference between greedy decoding and most likely decoding.
