\bigskip
{\bf Problem 1.} This problem is class-conditional GANs.  Here we consider a dataset, such as imagenet, consisting of a set of pairs where each pair
consists of a image and class label.  In class-conditional GAN we view the class label as the input $x$ and the image as the thing to be predicted $y$.
Obviously there is a lot of variation in the images that can be labeled as a dog.  In a class-conditional GAN we build a model $P_\Phi(y|x)$ where $x$ is a class
label and $y$ is an image.

\medskip
(a) Write the conditional GAN adversarial objective function for this problem in terms of $P_\Phi(y|x)$ and $P_\Psi(i|y,x)$.

\medskip
(b) Let $\hat{y}_\Phi(z)$ be the image output by a deconvolution CNN given a noise tensor input $z$.  Describe an input noise tensor $z$ that would be appropriate for
sampling from $P_\Phi(y|x)$ when $x$ is a class label.
