\bigskip
{\bf Problem 1.}  Consider convolving an $N \times N$ filter over a $D\times D$ input image $x$ (with $\lfloor N/2\rfloor$ padding) stride 1 to produce a $D \times D$ output image $y$.  Assume the input image has $C_x$ channels and the output image image has $C_y$ channels and we have batch size $B$.
How many floating point multiplies are required
in computing the convolution on the batch (without any activation function)?
