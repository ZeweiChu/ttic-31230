{\bf Problem 1.} This problem is on a CTC-like algorithm for image labeling.

Suppose that the training data consists of pairs $(I,S)$ where $I$ is an image and $S$
is a set of object types occuring in the image.  For example $S$ might be $\{\mathrm{Person},\mathrm{Dog},\mathrm{Car}\}$.
To be concrete we can take ${\cal C}$ to be the set of image labels used in CIFAR 100 and take $S$ to be a subset
of ${\cal C}$ containing no more than five labels ($|S| \leq 5$).
We want to do SGD on a model defining $P_\Phi(S\;|\;I)$.

We will use a latent variable $z[X,Y]$ such that for pixel coordinates $(x,y)$ we have $z[x,y] \in {\cal C} \cup \{\bot\}$.
For a given $z[X,Y]$ define $S(z[X,Y])$ to be the set of classes appearing in $z[X,Y]$, i.e.,
$S(z[X,Y]) = \{c\;\exists\;x,y\;z(x,y) = c\}$. Here the ``semantic segmentation'' $Z[X,Y]$ is analogous to the phoneme
sequence $z[T]$ in CTC. Unlike the CTC model, the label
$S$ is a set rather than a sequence.

We assume a CNN (with convolutions of stride 1 to preserve spatial dimensions) followed by
a softmax at each pixel to get a probability
$P_\Phi(z[x,y] = c)$ for each pixel location $(x,y)$ and each $c \in {\cal C} \cup \{\bot\}$ and where
each pixel location has an independent probability distribution over classes. 
To simplify notation we can reshape the pixel locations into a linear sequence
and replace $z[X,Y]$ by $z[T]$ with $T = X \times Y$so we have $z[0],z[1],\ldots,z[T-1]$.

Define
$$S_t = \{c \in {\cal C}\;\exists t'\leq t\;z[t'] = c\}$$
For $U \subseteq S$ define
$$F[U,t] = P(S_t = U)$$
Note that for $|S| \leq 5$ there are at most 32 possible values of $U$.
Give dynamic programming equations defining $F[U,0]$ and defining $F[U,t+1]$ in term of $F[U',t]$ for various $U'$.
